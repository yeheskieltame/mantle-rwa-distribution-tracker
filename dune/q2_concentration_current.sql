-- Q2: Current holder concentration for one RWA token on Mantle
-- Live: https://dune.com/queries/7863618  (dashboard: https://dune.com/yeheskiel/mantle-rwa-distribution-tracker)
-- Dashboard widgets: counters (holders, top-1 %, external float %) + net supply
-- Params: {{token_address}} default SPCXx 0x68fa...ce28 ; {{issuer_wallet}} default 0x5f7a...a2aD

-- Balances are reconstructed in EXACT 256-bit integer math via decimal(38,0) — NOT double.
-- double loses integer precision above ~2^53, which is why the old ">1e6 dust" hack existed;
-- with exact math a zero balance is exactly zero and holder counts are exact.
