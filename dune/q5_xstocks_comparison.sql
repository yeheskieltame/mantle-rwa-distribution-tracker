-- Q5: xStock ecosystem league on Mantle — the thesis at ecosystem scale (FLAGSHIP)
-- Live: https://dune.com/queries/7863671  (dashboard: https://dune.com/yeheskiel/mantle-rwa-distribution-tracker)
-- Universe = every token on Mantle whose NAME contains "xStock" (Backed's tokenized equities).
-- We match on name, NOT `symbol LIKE '%x'` (that catches junk like 100x / 55X / Arcane Flux).
-- LEFT JOIN keeps xStocks with ZERO on-chain activity, labelled ISSUED, NO HOLDERS.
-- Top holder is the issuer/treasury proxy for external float (no per-token issuer map needed).
-- Dashboard widget: table, sorted by holders DESC. Exact decimal(38,0) balances.
