-- Q10: xStock holders over time (ecosystem) — is the gap closing or widening? (NEW)
-- Live: https://dune.com/queries/7865851  (dashboard: https://dune.com/yeheskiel/mantle-rwa-distribution-tracker)
-- Weekly count of distinct external wallets holding ANY xStock (exact end-of-week balance > 0),
-- plus wallets holding their first xStock that week. Issuer + zero address excluded.
-- Result 2026-07-02: 926 holders total; +816 (88%) arrived in ONE 4-week window
-- (Apr 13 - May 10, 2026); single-digit weekly growth since. Distribution is event-driven.
